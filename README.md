The problem with a single password based keypad lock was that the password had to be deliberately changed by
us if we were unsure of it’s secrecy. What if the lock changed it’s password on it’s own on a daily basis? Now if
this was the case, then we don’t need to be unsure of the password’s privacy, ‘cause even if someone knew about
a certain day’s password, it won’t an issue as that password would become invalid the next day itself, by itself!
This is the key feature of Intilock known as One Day Password (ODP).
